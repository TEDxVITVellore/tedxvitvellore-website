            <h2>What is TED?</h2>
            <p className="grey gap">TED is an acronym for technology, entertainment, and design. It is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization committed to spreading innovative ideas and exciting discoveries through 18-minute talks delivered in front of live audiences at TED conferences.TED is dedicated to researching and sharing knowledge that matters. Scientists, researchers, technologists, business leaders, artists, designers, and other world experts take the TED stage to present "Ideas Worth Spreading."</p>

            <h2>What is TEDx?</h2>
            <p className="grey gap">TEDx events are held at a local community level and are independently organized by volunteers. Much like TED, TEDx events center around short, prepared talks, performances, and demonstrations emphasizing ideas that provoke learning, inspiration, and wonder. The events lay emphasis on community and allow the speakers, who wouldn't usually get access to a stage, to speak and communicate their ideas. Like TED, TEDx encourages thought-provoking and impactful ideas and does not promote religious, commercial, or political bias/agenda.</p>
