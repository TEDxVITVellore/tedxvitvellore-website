            <p>"The Ripple effect" was an event that focused on the butterfly effect and how small life choices and alterations can lead to a spreading, pervasive, and usually unintentional influence on our lives as well as others. The theme brought out the importance of action and how deep and meaningful it can be in its impact on life. To sum up, Ripple was a highly motivating event and gave the required push to the audience so that they followed their dreams fearlessly.</p>
